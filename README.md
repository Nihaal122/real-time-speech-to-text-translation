## 🧠 Engineering Highlights (Interview Talking Points)

- Designed a stable speech-processing pipeline avoiding unreliable continuous loops  
- Handled speech recognition and translation latency effectively  
- Integrated ASR and machine translation into a single workflow  
- Built a clean and modular Streamlit UI suitable for real-world demos  

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- Requires an active internet connection for speech recognition and translation  
- Microphone permissions must be enabled  
- Optimized for clarity and reliability rather than continuous streaming
